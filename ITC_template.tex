%The framedbox command anchors the box on its centerline/top.
% The first argument is the width of the box (in 1/16 of the page width) and the second argument is the
% position on the page (of the anchor point). 0,0 means top left while 16,16
% means bottom right of the page. The height of the box grows
% automatically with its content.
